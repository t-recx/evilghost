 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because I firmly believe that presents are not to be thrown away, I 
humbly accept the gift of 'The Act of Generosity' and choose to ignore
the second technical requirement 'Get a Grip'.

Genre Requirements

 1. Evilness
 -----------
 In my game, the player plays a ghost whose main objective is to kill
people by scaring them to death. The score is different depending on
how you scare the person. For example, luring the player close to the
ghost and then appear from nowhere to scare the person gets a higher 
score than just standing in the end of the corridor waiting for the 
victim.

Technical Requirements

 1. Radius of Influence
 ----------------------
 When a person sees a ghost it will get scared and run. The speed at
which they do so varies according to the distance to the player.

 2. Get a Grip
 -------------
 Ignored, as stated above.

 3. Ratio Respect
 ----------------
 When playing the game in widescreen, a bar called 'evil meter' appears
at the right of the screen. When it gets full the player will receive 
an extra life. When not in game, but still in widescreen, the phrase
'Speedhack 2007' appears there. In the beginning of the game the player
is given the choice to choose if he wants to play in widescreen or 
fullscreen.

Artistic Requirements

 1. Reverse Stereotypes
 ----------------------
 Ever since cats started living with human beings that they have been 
attributed mystical powers. We can see what our ancestors thought about
cats if we analyse the history of the previous civilizations. In Ancient
Egypt, for instance, cats were considered gods and the remains of both 
statues and painted figures of cats, depicted in various divine 
activities, are abundant. Witches were always accompanied by black cats 
and single women worldwide have lived with cats that were apparently 
equipped with special male-repellent devices. Even today, there are 
entire websites claiming that cats are an alien species or that cats - 
not humans! - form the illuminati. 
 But we don’t have to go that far; just looking at any regular domestic 
cat can provide insight into cats’ paranormal abilities. How many times 
haven’t we caught cats staring at the empty space, sometimes even 
meowing at it? What is it that they are looking at?
 World leading experts in the fields of the paranormal have concluded 
through almost-scientifically tests that cats were in fact looking at 
ghosts. I humbly accept that explanation for it was not me who studied at 
the Paranoia Groove College for several years under the supervision of a 
grey alien named Steve Wonky-Donky.
 After carefully pondering over the issue, I decided to reverse this well 
known and extensively researched stereotype in my game. ‘No cat shall see 
a ghost ever again in my game!’ – I exclaimed in the middle of a 
classroom filled with several young adults and one middle aged teacher. 
Much to my surprise, the applause followed.

 2. Dialogue
 -----------
 The player is given two keys: Z and X. Both of them send messages to 
nearby persons, but the messages have different meanings: Z lures the
persons while X scares them even more. The persons respond to in different
ways to different messages thus creating dialogue.
 This feature affects gameplay in the following ways:
  a) Sending a scary message will get more points to the player;
  b) Luring people assists the player in fulfilling the ultimate game goal:
Scaring them. 

 About the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The game takes place after the death of William Applegate - a stock market 
analyst; his huge mansion, once an opulent manifestation of his wealth, 
has been transformed into a luxury hotel. Unable to rest in his afterlife 
knowing that his $10000 dolar jacuzzi would be used by anyone other than
him, the ghost of the analyst returns to the mansion to expel everyone there 
- 'If I can't have it, then nobody else will - bwahaha!'. However, he quickly 
finds that he has limited time and that he can only travel in one division
at a time. Using his clever analyzing capabilities he divides his mansion 
into parts that he calls 'levels' and uses whatever time he has left in the
earth-plane to scare the rich stock market analysts that are spending their
vacations in his mansion-turned-hotel thing. The servants of the house are 
not happy about it however. First, because a haunted hotel is an empty, 
out-of-work hotel and second, because they never really liked mr. Applegate
anyway. Scare the people on the hotel within the limited timeframe but avoid 
your employees at all costs. 


 How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Control
 --------
 Cursor keys 	- Move
 Z 		- Lure nearby persons (be careful, the employees are also lured!)
 X 		- Send a scary message

 The main objective of the game is to scare the guests to dead. Don't worry
it's very easy, you only need to appear in front of them. You have to kill all
the guests in each level to pass to the next level. And you have to do so
within a limited timeframe.
 The player is only visible to the other people while moving. And it has to 
be in their eye-sight to be spotted. Walls can and should be used for covering.
 The closer the player is to the people the bigger the score he'll gets when
they get scared.
