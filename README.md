# Introduction

This was my [Allegro Speedhack](http://www.speedhack.allegro.cc) 2007 entry. You had to make a game during the weekend for this competition.

It's a silly stealth game where you play as a ghost.

You'll need Allegro and DUMB (compiled for allegro) to build it.

# Instructions

 Cursor keys 	- Move

 Z 		- Lure nearby persons (be careful, the employees are also lured!)

 X 		- Send a scary message

The main objective of the game is to scare the guests to dead. Don't worry it's very easy, you only need to appear in front of them. You have to kill all the guests in each level to pass to the next level. And you have to do so
within a limited timeframe.

The player is only visible to the other people while moving. And it has to be in their eye-sight to be spotted. Walls can and should be used for covering.

The closer the player is to the people the bigger the score he'll gets when they get scared.
